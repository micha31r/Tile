## Tile

Just 4 goals a day, and friends to keep you motivated.  
  
### Problem:  
  
It's easy to overplan with modern apps, where there's no limit to how many tasks you can add. That overplanning creates a false sense of productivity, and when things change, your plan breaks and tasks pile up. It's also easy to lose motivation and procrastinate when you can freely edit and rearrange tasks (there's always the tomorrow column waiting).  
  
### With Tile:  

• Lock in 4 goals before noon.  
• Build your streak.  
• See friends' progress.
